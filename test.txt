National Narrative On population
Pakistan's progress on most health, education and demographic indicators has slowed down according to the
population census 2017 and the Pakistan demographic and Health Survey (PDHS) 2017-2018. These trends signify 
a worsening of existing inequalities and imbalances, threatening the country's shrinking resource base as well
as its future viability and stablility. The situation warrants urgent corrective actions at all levels of 
State and society.
As a key measure, Paksitan must lose no further time
in joining the countires of the region and the Muslim world
in achieving a rate of population growth that is sustainable.
